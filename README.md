# 380v9mmSorter
A 3D printed bullet casing sorter for separating 9mm from .380 

All printed parts were printed in polymaker PLA+ with 3 perimiters and 15% infill. I used the "organic" supports
in the latest alpha build of PrusaSlice https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/  to avoid supports causing 
parts to have unnessesary roughness. 

I printed the main sorter body oriented upright with the face of the .380 outlet down on the build plate. 
This gave me the best print quality results.

This project is not in a tested nor final form, expect things to change as problems are identified and addressed. 

Here is a list of all of the non-printed parts I have used for this project:

### Hardware
M3 hardware is used everywhere expect on the motor. M2 is used on the motor both for mounting and as a cross pin
 to hold the wheel to the motor shaft.

I used a flat washer on each side of the crank shaft to reduce friction and use a drop of locktite to 
keep the nut from walking itself off. maybe I can work on embedding a nylock nut and shoulder bolt or something
in the future but this is were its at now.
